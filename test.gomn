  at the moment, basic values are
    the only types which don't require
    type assertion after retrieval
    (unless you attempt to do something like string() of a rune, then it's suddenly an interface{}) 

  maps are returned as type:
    gomn.Map

  most other types are returned as type of:
    interface{}
  so you must use type assertion after
  getting those types

  the file is treated as a map
